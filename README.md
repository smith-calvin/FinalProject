SAL 603 Final Project

This analysis seeks to compare the performance of various team-level predictors of Points Per Match (PPM) across the five major European football leagues. 
By examining the strength of correlations between metrics like 'Goals For', 'Possession', and 'Total Passes Into Final Third', I aim to identify 
league-specific trends that may reflect the underlying tactical approaches in these leagues. Ultimately, the goal is to understand how the style of play 
in each league influences which metrics are most predictive of team success.
